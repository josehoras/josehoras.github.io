Well, I am finally starting a blog. There have been times in the past that I entertained the thought of starting a blog, but didn’t got to do it. For example, as I started my year backpacking around South East Asia I really though a blog was a great way of documenting my travels and keep in touch with friends and family. However, as I started travelling, I found a better use of my time was to focus on living the places I was visiting instead of writing about them.
So, why start now? Do I think I’ll have more exciting adventures to tell, and more followers, writing about learning artificial intelligence instead of about surfing in Bali? Not really...
But I do think writing can help me more on this travel than on my backpacking. Writing is a great way to really fix new concepts in your mind. I found the best way to deeply understand something is to explain it. Frequently we think we understand something until the time we have to put that concept into words. Then new questions and ideas arise, and when the explaining is done, we may have new insights on that old concept. As I don’t expect to find many volunteers willing to be schooled into AI by me, writing a blog would be a better option to achieve this.
